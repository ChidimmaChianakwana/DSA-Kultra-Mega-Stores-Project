## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Shipping Cost vs Order Priority
```
Edit

GROUP BY Ship_Mode, Order_Priority
ORDER BY Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
```
**Findings:**

Critical orders often shipped via Delivery Truck, costing more than Express Air in total.

Some low and medium priority orders also used expensive methods.

Assumed cost ranking (Truck < Air) doesn‚Äôt hold true in all cases ‚Äî likely due to package size/weight.

## Recommendations:

Perform cost-per-unit analysis for each shipping method.

Align shipping method with order priority.

Revisit logistics contracts.

##üí° Key Takeaways
Technology is the leading revenue driver ‚Äî focus on upselling in this category.

Underperforming regions need targeted marketing.

Shipping cost allocation should be data-driven, not assumption-based.

Retention strategies for low-value customers can boost long-term sales.

Product returns warrant deeper quality control reviews.
